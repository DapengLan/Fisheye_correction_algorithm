# Fisheye_correction_algorithm

This project implemented 4 algorithms for fisheye corrections.
Running environment: matlab.

-Spherical_coordinates.m:2D spherical coordinates algorithm

-Spherical_perspective_projection.mï¼šspherical perspective projection algorithm

-fish_2D.m: 2D stereoscopic projection coordinate transformation (spherical projection model)

-fish_correction.m, fish_3D_origin.m: Display correction of spherical perspective projection model based on the fish-eye image is divided into left and right and up and down the center of five grid
